What is Sistrence?
------------------

Sistrence is a database abstraction library for PHP5. I've been using it in
dozens of projects under the name "jmDB" for about six years now. It's fairly
stable and it's got a few neat features, so I'm releasing it as open-source at
this time.

There isn't much documentation for it yet, but I hope to add more in the future.


How to use it?
--------------

You can either use it on the database layer:

// Create new operation
$op = Sis::op('mytable');

// Set a condition id=15
$op->eq('id', 15);

// Fetch one row
$row = $op->doGetOne();

// Print something from the data
echo $row['title'];

Or you can define database objects...

class Customer extends SisObject
{
	const TABLE = 'tbl_customer';
}

... and use them:

$customer = new Customer(15);
echo $customer['name'];

And that's it, really. :)


How do I set it up?
-------------------

Put the sistrence folder somewhere in your include path. Then do:

require_once 'sistrence/inc.php';
Sis::connect_mysqli('database_user', 'password', 'localhost', 'database_name');

And once again you're done.
